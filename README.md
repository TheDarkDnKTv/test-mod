## Before launching MC

Make sure you installed new mappings.

1. Download zip file from [here](https://mcpbot.unascribed.com/mcp_stable/12-1.7.10/)
2. Unpack it to `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches\minecraft\net\minecraftforge\forge\1.7.10-10.13.4.1614-1.7.10\unpacked\conf\ `

On first run there will be window to select mappings folder, select same folder you unpacked archive before.

## Installing dependencies mods

Since we are using never mapping, we need to download or universal version, or deobf using our mapping themselves.
If you need to check `func_XXX` to name mapping, use files in that folder from before:
- fields.csv
- methods.csv
